# To-Do List Application

## Description

The To-Do List Application is a simple and user-friendly web app that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. It features a clean interface where users can add, check, and remove tasks easily. The app uses local storage to save tasks, ensuring that the data persists even when the page is refreshed.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Users can enter tasks into an input field and click "Add" to add them to the list.
- **Check/Uncheck Tasks:** Click on a task to mark it as completed. The completed tasks are visually distinct with a strikethrough.
- **Remove Tasks:** Each task has a delete button (represented by an "x") that allows users to remove tasks from the list.
- **Persistent Storage:** Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so they remain even after refreshing the page.
